# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: >
  I'm a Data Scientist, educated in Stats and ML, working in the field since 2013.
  Learned to code on the job; mainly Python, R and Scala.
  Things I'm enthusiastic about include: Natural Language Processing and information extraction, Recommender Systems,
  web user behaviour modelling and personalisation, analytics, forecasting, anomaly detection,
  Causal Inference and Fairness in AI.
  When I'm not working you will find me being a tourist somewhere, hiking in the mountains, cycling in fair weather
  or playing those two/three pieces I still remember on the piano.
